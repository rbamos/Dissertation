Lessons, takeaways, impact

We have introduced two longitudinal datasets that are the largest of their class. 

\section{Impact}
As the largest longitudinal dataset of privacy policies, our longitudinal dataset of privacy policies has received \raNote{X} requests from research teams around the world, with purposes ranging from \raNote{X} to \raNote{Z}.

As the largest longitudinal dataset of reviews, we are hopeful that our reviews dataset will have a similar impact on the academic community.
