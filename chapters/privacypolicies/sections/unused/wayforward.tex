\section{The Way Forward}

This section covers the ongoing work by the authors to analyze the dataset. In addition to developing the dataset, we aim to show that our dataset is of interest to the academic and regulatory communities by showcasing results we are able to obtain from analysis of the dataset.

\subsection{Phrase of interest extraction}
We are developing a pipeline to identify terms of interest in a semi-automated fashion. We first clean the documents by using named entity recognition. Our pipeline extracts and counts terms from the document using document frequency. We then use a variety of metrics to identify atypical terms and flag them for manual inspection.

Our final paper will showcase how such tools can be used to identify real-world concerns for regulators. We also hope to show how various regulations have impacted the privacy policy landscape.

\subsection{Privacy Seal case study}
We're using our dataset to try to understand the prevalence of privacy seals. Our preliminary results show that privacy seals were briefly going out of favor after 2014, but have seen a massive resurgence with GDPR. Our results also show that the privacy seal landscape has been dominated by by a single company, but this has been changing in recent years.
