\textbf{Release.} Our dataset and source code is available for public use.\footnote{ \url{https://privacypolicies.cs.princeton.edu/}} The access requests we have received have revealed a diversity of use cases for our data, including the study of responses to regulation, automated enforcement, health information technology, and ethics.

In addition to making data and code available, inspired by the TOSBack project~\cite{TOSBack}, we built a chronologically accurate GitHub repository of the policy documents in our dataset.
We used \emph{GitPython}~\cite{GitPython} to commit privacy policy texts and HTML sources (in a separate branch) using the time-of-archive timestamps and detailed privacy policy metadata. 
GitHub’s easy to use web interface enables users without technical skills to perform full text search, compare different versions of the same policy, or use the ``Blame’’ feature to trace modifications.
Finally, we built a separate web interface
to make it easier to search, filter, and explore the privacy policies in the GitHub repository.
