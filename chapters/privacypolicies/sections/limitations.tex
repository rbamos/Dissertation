\textbf{Limitations.}
Our data collection and analyses were limited to privacy policies; we did not analyze how archived websites track users or share personal data with third parties. 

For internationalized websites, the location of the Wayback Machine crawlers could determine the language of the archived site and its privacy policy. 
Although ``the vast majority of captures are initiated from the [United States],'' there is no way to determine the location, country, or IP address of the Wayback Machine crawlers that captured a particular snapshot~\cite{crawl-location-tweet-by-graham}.


For our readability discussion, we noted that readability metrics have limitations; they do not consider organization, formatting, or length of the document, nor the semantic difficulty of the document. 

In our discussion of how terms trend over time, we used (typically handcrafted) regular expressions to search for referenced terms. Despite our best efforts and extensive manual validation, these regular expressions may capture terms that we did not intend to capture. They additionally may capture terms we intended to capture, but do not fit the targeted concept, and they may miss terms that fit the targeted concept.
