\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ppot:conclusion}
We developed a system for the longitudinal, large-scale, automated collection and curation of privacy policies. Using the system we built a dataset of over 1M privacy policies that span more than two decades. We found that privacy policies are becoming longer and harder to read.

We developed an automated trend surfacing tool and investigated some of the surfaced trends. Specifically, we investigated trends around third parties, tracking technologies, and self-regulatory bodies. Our results suggest that privacy policies show a concerning lack of transparency: the usage of third parties and tracking technologies is severely underreported.

Our results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting the inadequacy of the ``notice and choice'' model for privacy policy regulation and demonstrate the monumental impact of the GDPR.
