\chapter{Introduction}

The rise of the internet has introduced new challenges in consumer protection. Cheap and efficient data collection has introduced novel privacy risks. Low service costs have lead to novel profit collection methods, including an amazing variety of free services. Global marketplaces have lead to large drops in prices as online platforms reduce market friction and increase competition. The internet has given an opportunity to amplify the voices of many. The intense competition and the power of speech on the internet has created a strong incentive to engage in dishonest, self-serving speech. The very anonymity that protects those voices also protects the voices of those seeking to be dishonest.

Consumer protection is an important issue. Many jurisdictions ranging from local to national have passed consumer protection laws. In the United States, the primary national body governing consumer protect is the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), established by the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 \raNote{citeme}, and many states have their own entities focused on consumer protection. The FTC has highlighted a number of issues at the intersection of the internet and consumer protection including fair reviews and adequate disclosure of privacy practices.
